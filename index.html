    <h1>🥐Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      <br />
      You may have already read the shocking news elsewhere: croissants weren’t
      invented in France. (Ok, you’re probably just curious about the factoid,
      but never mind). As with every aspect of tracing the croissant’s tortuous
      history, however, it’s actually a bit more complicated than that. Most
      food historians trace the origins of the croissant to Austria and
      elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small pastries called kipferl had been
      made since at least the 13th century, according to numerous records.
